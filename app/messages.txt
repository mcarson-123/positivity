Don't judge each day by the harvest you reap but by the seeds that you plant.
We are all alike, on the inside.
All life is an experiment. The more experiments you make the better.
The best way to cheer yourself up is to cheer everyone else up.
Live life and live it good.
Be yourself, who else is better qualified.
Say what you mean, mean what you say, but don't say it mean.
We are all different. Don't judge, understand instead.
We don't see things as they are, we see them as we are.
Positive anything is better than negative nothing.
You don't have to go fast, you just have to go.
We are what we believe we are.
It is easy to be brave from a safe distance.
